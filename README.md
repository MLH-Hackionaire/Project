  <h3>SnakeMate Game<h3>
  
 We have built a "Snakes and ladder" plus "Chess" board game.
 
 It is a multiplayer game that combine aspects of game mechanism from both, the traditional "Snakes and ladder" game and "Chess".
 
  <h4>Game Rules<h4>
        
        1.For getting started, the player has to get "1" or "6" on the dice.
        
        2.After the player is onboard the game, he will roll the dice again and will be assigned a chess piece 
          that may be a King,Knight,Rook or a Pawn.
          
        3.The following conditions are follwed by the various chess pieces:
            
            a.A King can move forward or upword in direction.
            b.A Knight will move forward by three steps if the die rolled is 3,4 or 5. If the die rolled is 6 then it will move 6
              steps and if the die is lower than 3 then it will not move. 
            c.A Rook can move any number of steps forward in that particular row.
            d.A pawn can only move one step forward.
