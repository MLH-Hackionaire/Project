 # SnakeMate Game
  
 We have built a "Snakes and Ladders" plus "Chess" board game.
 
 It is a multiplayer game that combine aspects of game mechanism from both, the traditional "Snakes and Ladders" game and "Chess".
 
  # Game Rules
  1.Once the player is on the board, he will roll the dice again and will be assigned a chess piece 
      that may be a King, Knight, Rook or a Pawn.
      
    2.When you roll a 6, you get an extra turn.
      
    3.The following conditions are follwed by the various chess pieces:
        
        a.A King can move forward or upward in direction, by one block. 
        b.A Knight will move forward by three steps if the die rolled is 3,4 or 5. If the die rolled is 6 then it will move 6
          steps and if the die is rolled lower than 3 then it will not move. 
        c.A Rook can move any number of steps forward in that particular row, and so it will move the number rolled by the die.
        d.A pawn can only move one step forward, irrespective of the number rolled by the die.
